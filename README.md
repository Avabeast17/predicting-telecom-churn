Telecom Churn Prediction & Retention Playbook
This project goes beyond just predicting which telecom customers will leave. It answers the deeper question: Why are they leaving—and how can we make them stay?

Project Overview
In a highly competitive telecom market, churn isn’t just a metric it’s a warning. Using explainable AI and predictive modeling, this case study turns raw customer data into actionable retention strategies. With precision, empathy, and a focus on impact, the project blends technical depth with business relevance.


Objectives
Predict customer churn with high recall.

Identify key behavioral and billing patterns driving churn.

Develop a practical, scalable Retention Playbook Generator.

Deliver transparency using SHAP explainability for trust and clarity.

Support business decision-making with targeted strategies.

My Role
Lead Data Analyst & AI Developer

Owned the full lifecycle: data wrangling, modeling, explainability, deployment prep.

Built the logic behind the Retention Playbook and decision support visuals.


Tools Used
Python: scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, SHAP

Azure Machine Learning Studio (deployment environment)

Power BI and Excel (for stakeholder visuals)

Highlights
Built a Random Forest model with 79% accuracy and strong recall for churners.

SHAP values exposed top drivers: high charges, short tenure, month-to-month contracts.

Created a Retention Playbook Generator that matches risky customer traits to retention actions.

Developed a logic-based framework that could power automated outreach, CRM integration, or targeted marketing.

Why This Matters
Most churn models stop at prediction. This one goes further it gives businesses something to act on. It shows how data science can collaborate with customer success, marketing, and operations to actually move the needle.

Next Steps
Implement clustering to uncover hidden churn personas.

Deploy the Retention Playbook into a dashboard interface.

Expand model with real-time usage data and sentiment analysis.
